# PortStation
Portstation is a social media platform where everybody can share their idea or their activity as image or video or document. this website also have forum feature where everybody can see latest article including make a comment inside it.

In this website, user can see another user's activity by click "Follow" button and they can see their activity without access their profile first. this website also have "Block User" button if user want hiding their activity from another user's. 

This website inspired from instagram and Arstation and my purpose to make this website just to make portfolio only and just focus on back-end website only.

Technology which I'm using in this portfolio are : 
- Bootstrap
- Django
- Mailnest
